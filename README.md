# SEC-Petitions
This repo is for collaborative drafting requests for SEC rules and policy changes, through the tools provided by regulators to retail investors. This includes but is not limited to SEC Petitions and commenting on ongoing proposals for rules adjustments.

Issues in this repo track concepts and possible suggestions to either improve the tutorials and resources present or describe / suggest subjects for new petition submissions.

WhyDRS has a basic guide onsite for SEC Petition drafting and submission which is located at: https://www.whydrs.org/sec-petitions-for-rule-updates
